        <h1>This is my story üòç</h1>
        <p>
            My name is Marziyeh (Mari). I have a background in chemistry, but when I moved to the UK two years ago, I
            realised that
            I really liked some technology, such as computer science. Because I am a creative person, I also realised
            that software
            Development helps me with this, so I am now a student of software, which is exactly what I wanted.
            I am an excellent swimmer who performs at a high level in this sport. I am also very creative in cooking and
            love to
            cook delicious meals since I love to try out different recipes.
            I often consider my future career. My main goal, however, is to find the ideal junior position in a good
            company after
            learning to code. Every day, I'll work to advance my knowledge and skills since I want to work as a senior
            manager for
            one of the biggest companies in the UK in a few years.
